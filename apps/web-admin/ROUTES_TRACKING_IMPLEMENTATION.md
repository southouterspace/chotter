## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. `useTechnicianLocationsEnhanced` fetches initial technician data
2. Subscribes to Realtime changes on `technicians` and `tickets` tables
3. On change event, refreshes all data to maintain consistency
4. `TechnicianMap` renders markers and routes from data
5. Click events update selected technician state
6. InfoWindow displays detailed information

### Database Queries
```typescript
// Fetch technicians with person data
.from('technicians')
  .select('id, current_location, status, persons(...)')
  .eq('business_id', BUSINESS_ID)
  .eq('active', true)

// Fetch active routes
.from('routes')
  .select('id, technician_id, status')
  .in('technician_id', technicianIds)
  .eq('status', 'active')

// Fetch appointments (tickets)
.from('tickets')
  .select('id, route_id, status, scheduled_time, customers(...)')
  .in('route_id', routeIds)
```

### Real-Time Subscriptions
```typescript
// Technician location updates
channel: 'technician_locations_enhanced'
table: 'technicians'
filter: `business_id=eq.${BUSINESS_ID}`

// Ticket/appointment updates
channel: 'ticket_updates'
table: 'tickets'
```

### Route Polylines
- Automatically drawn from current location to appointment stops
- Blue stroke (#3b82f6) with 80% opacity
- Geodesic paths for accurate distance
- Only shown when `showRoutes` is enabled

## Environment Variables
Requires `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` to be set for map functionality.

## Error Handling
- Missing API key: Shows friendly error message
- No technicians: Displays empty state message
- Failed data fetch: Shows error with retry capability
- Missing location data: Filters out technicians without coordinates

## Performance Optimizations
- Memoized map controls to prevent re-renders
- Filtered technicians before rendering (only those with locations)
- Efficient state updates using useCallback
- Cleanup of map polylines on unmount
- Debounced real-time updates to prevent excessive re-renders

## Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ Map displays all active technicians
- ✅ Markers update in real-time when locations change
- ✅ Markers color-coded by technician status
- ✅ Click marker shows technician info popup
- ✅ Route polylines display for active routes
- ✅ Sidebar shows list of technicians
- ✅ Map centers on user's business location by default
- ✅ Performance acceptable with 10+ technicians

## Usage
Navigate to `/routes` or click "Routes" in the navigation header to access the live tracking map.

## Future Enhancements
- ETA calculations to next stop
- Traffic layer integration
- Geofencing for appointment locations
- Historical route playback
- Push notifications for status changes
- Batch assignment of technicians to routes
- Route optimization suggestions
