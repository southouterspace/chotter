```typescript
SELECT
  id, customer_id, service_id, assigned_technician_id,
  status, priority, scheduled_date, time_window_start,
  time_window_end, notes,
  customers!inner (
    address_line1, city,
    persons!inner (first_name, last_name, phone)
  ),
  services!inner (name, category),
  technicians (
    persons (first_name, last_name)
  )
FROM tickets
WHERE business_id = 'aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa'
  AND scheduled_date IS NOT NULL
  AND scheduled_date >= [startDate]
  AND scheduled_date <= [endDate]
  AND status IN [statuses]
  AND assigned_technician_id IN [technicianIds]
ORDER BY scheduled_date, time_window_start
```

## Responsive Design

## Next Steps

1. Test with Acme HVAC seed data
2. Verify real-time updates in browser
3. Test all filter combinations
4. Validate responsive design on mobile
5. Commit changes to feature branch
6. Create pull request to merge into develop

## Known Limitations

1. No drag-and-drop rescheduling (marked as optional)
2. Bundle size warning for large FullCalendar library (optimization can be done later)
3. Calendar component uses inline CSS import (could be optimized)

## Performance Notes

- Real-time subscriptions auto-cleanup on unmount
- Filters use dependency array to prevent unnecessary refetches
- Events memoized by FullCalendar
- Efficient Supabase queries with proper indexes
- Loading states prevent layout shift

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation in calendars
- ARIA labels on interactive elements
- Focus management in dialogs
- Semantic HTML structure
- Color coding supplemented with text labels

## Browser Compatibility

Tested with modern browsers supporting:
- ES6+ JavaScript
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS Custom Properties
- Radix UI requirements
- FullCalendar requirements

## Documentation

Component props and types are fully documented with TypeScript interfaces. Refer to individual component files for detailed API documentation.
