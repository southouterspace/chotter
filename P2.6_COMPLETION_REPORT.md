## Files Created

### 1. Database Migration
**File:** `/supabase/migrations/20251020000000_add_technician_certifications_support.sql`

- Added `tag_value JSONB` column to `technician_tags` table
- Supports structured certification data with issue date, expiry date, and certification number
- Created GIN index for efficient JSONB queries

**Certification Structure:**
```json
{
  "issue_date": "2024-01-01",
  "expiry_date": "2026-01-01",
  "number": "ABC123"
}
```

### 2. CertificationsSelector Component
**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/components/CertificationsSelector.tsx`

Features:
- Add/remove certifications dynamically
- Fields: name, issue date, expiry date (optional), certification number (optional)
- Visual warnings for expired/expiring certifications
- Responsive card-based UI
- Form validation

### 3. TechnicianMetrics Component
**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/components/TechnicianMetrics.tsx`

Displays six key performance metrics:
1. **Total Jobs** - All assigned tickets
2. **Completed Jobs** - Successfully completed tickets
3. **Completion Rate** - Percentage of completed vs assigned
4. **Avg Job Duration** - Average time from check-in to completion
5. **On-Time Rate** - Jobs started within scheduled time window
6. **Customer Rating** - Average rating from customer feedback

Features:
- Color-coded metric cards (green/yellow/red based on thresholds)
- Icons for each metric
- Empty state for technicians with no jobs
- Loading skeletons
- Error handling

### 4. useTechnicianMetrics Hook
**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/hooks/useTechnicianMetrics.ts`

Functionality:
- Fetches all tickets for a technician
- Calculates completion rate
- Computes average job duration from `actual_start_time` and `actual_end_time`
- Determines on-time percentage based on scheduled time windows
- Aggregates customer ratings
- 5-minute cache with React Query

## Files Modified

### 1. Validation Schema
**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/lib/validation/technician.ts`

Added:
- `certificationSchema` with validation for name, issueDate, expiryDate, certificationNumber
- `certifications` field to `technicianFormSchema`

### 2. TechnicianForm Component
**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/components/TechnicianForm.tsx`

Changes:
- Imported `CertificationsSelector`
- Added certifications to default values
- Added certifications section in form
- Updated form reset logic

### 3. useTechnicians Hook
**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/hooks/useTechnicians.ts`

Changes:
- Added `Certification` interface
- Updated `TechnicianData` interface with certifications field
- Fetches certifications from `technician_tags` with `tag_type='certification'`
- Parses JSONB `tag_value` into certification objects

### 4. useCreateTechnician Hook
**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/hooks/useCreateTechnician.ts`

Changes:
- Creates certifications as tags with `tag_type='certification'`
- Stores structured data in `tag_value` JSONB column
- Handles both skills and certifications in single insert

### 5. useUpdateTechnician Hook
**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/hooks/useUpdateTechnician.ts`

Changes:
- Deletes all existing tags (skills + certifications)
- Recreates both skills and certifications
- Properly formats certification data for JSONB storage

### 6. TechnicianDetail Component
**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/components/TechnicianDetail.tsx`

Changes:
- Imported `TechnicianMetrics` component
- Added Performance Metrics section at top of detail view
- Split Skills and Certifications into separate cards
- Added certification display with:
  - Issue/expiry dates
  - Certification numbers
  - Expired/expiring soon badges and visual indicators
  - Color-coded borders for status

---

## Implementation Details

### Certifications Storage

Certifications are stored in the `technician_tags` table:

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `tag_type` | TEXT | Set to 'certification' |
| `name` | TEXT | Certification name (e.g., "HVAC Certified") |
| `tag_value` | JSONB | Structured data: `{ issue_date, expiry_date, number }` |

### Performance Metrics Calculation

**Completion Rate:**
```sql
(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') / COUNT(*)) * 100
```

**Average Job Duration:**
```sql
AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (actual_end_time - actual_start_time))/60)
```

**On-Time Percentage:**
- Checks if `actual_start_time` falls within scheduled time window
- Window defined by `time_window_start` and `time_window_end`
- Only counts completed jobs with scheduled times

**Customer Rating:**
```sql
AVG(customer_rating) WHERE customer_rating IS NOT NULL
```

## User Interface

### Certifications in TechnicianForm
- **Add Certification** button to create new entries
- Each certification in an expandable card
- Form fields:
  - Certification Name (required)
  - Issue Date (required, date picker)
  - Expiry Date (optional, date picker)
  - Certification Number (optional, text input)
- Remove button per certification
- Visual warnings for expired/expiring certifications

### Certifications in TechnicianDetail
- Displayed in dedicated "Certifications" card
- Each certification shows:
  - Name in bold
  - Issue and expiry dates
  - Certification number (if available)
  - Status badge (Active/Expiring Soon/Expired)
- Color-coded borders:
  - Red for expired
  - Yellow for expiring within 30 days
  - Default for active

### Performance Metrics Display
- Grid layout (3 columns on desktop, responsive)
- Six metric cards with:
  - Icon
  - Label
  - Large value display
  - Description text
  - Color-coded backgrounds based on performance thresholds

**Thresholds:**
- **Completion Rate:** Green ≥80%, Yellow ≥60%, Red <60%
- **On-Time Rate:** Green ≥85%, Yellow ≥70%, Red <70%
- **Customer Rating:** Green ≥4.5, Blue ≥4.0, Yellow ≥3.0, Red <3.0

ALTER TABLE technician_tags
ADD COLUMN tag_value JSONB DEFAULT NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_technician_tags_value ON technician_tags USING GIN (tag_value);
```

**To Apply:**
```bash
# Local Supabase
supabase db push

# Or through Supabase Dashboard
# Paste migration contents into SQL Editor and run
```
