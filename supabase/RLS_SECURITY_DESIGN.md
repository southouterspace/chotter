# Chotter Row Level Security (RLS) Design

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive Row Level Security implementation for Chotter's multi-tenant SaaS platform. RLS policies ensure complete data isolation between businesses and enforce role-based access control within each business.

## Migration Files

1. **00000000000006_rls_platform.sql** - Platform-owner tables (7 tables, 29 policies)
2. **00000000000007_rls_business.sql** - Business-level tables (21 tables, 94 policies)

**Total Security Coverage:** 28 tables, 123 RLS policies

## Security Architecture

### Core Principles

1. **Deny by Default** - All tables have RLS enabled with no implicit access
2. **Multi-Tenant Isolation** - Strict business_id enforcement prevents cross-tenant data leakage
3. **Role Hierarchy** - `super_admin > admin > technician > customer`
4. **Least Privilege** - Users only see data necessary for their role
5. **Append-Only Protection** - Audit and billing tables cannot be modified
6. **Privacy by Design** - Customer data hidden from inappropriate roles

### JWT Claims Structure

RLS policies rely on JWT claims populated by Supabase Auth:

```json
{
  "person_id": "uuid",      // Current authenticated user's person.id
  "business_id": "uuid",    // User's business (null for super_admins)
  "role": "customer"        // One of: customer, technician, admin, super_admin
}
```

### Helper Functions

Five security helper functions extract JWT claims for use in policies:

```sql
current_person_id()     -- Returns authenticated user's person_id
current_business_id()   -- Returns user's business_id
current_user_role()     -- Returns user's role string
is_super_admin()        -- Boolean check for super_admin role
is_authenticated()      -- Boolean check if user has person_id
```

## Append-Only Tables

Six tables are append-only for audit trail and billing integrity:

2. **usage_events** - Feature usage tracking (billing)
3. **location_history** - GPS breadcrumbs (90-day retention)
4. **geofence_events** - Arrival/departure triggers
5. **status_history** - Ticket status audit trail
6. **route_events** - Route optimization history
7. **ai_usage_events** - AI billing events

**Security:** No UPDATE or DELETE policies created. INSERT-only via system.

## Multi-Tenant Isolation

### Business Boundary Enforcement

All business-level tables enforce `business_id = current_business_id()` in policies:

```sql
-- Example: Prevents cross-tenant access
CREATE POLICY tickets_select_admin ON tickets
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    business_id = current_business_id()
    AND current_user_role() = 'admin'
  );
```

### Super Admin Bypass

Super admins can bypass business_id checks for platform management:

```sql
-- Example: Super admin sees all tickets
CREATE POLICY tickets_select_super_admin ON tickets
  FOR SELECT
  USING (is_super_admin());
```

## Field-Level Protection

### Critical Fields Protected

Certain fields can only be modified by specific roles:

**Business Table:**
- `status`, `trial_ends_at`, `activated_at` → Super admin only
- Business admins cannot change their own subscription status

**Persons Table:**
- `role`, `business_id` → Cannot be self-modified
- Prevents privilege escalation

**Technicians Table:**
- `hire_date`, `hourly_rate_cents` → Admin only
- Technicians can't modify compensation

**Tickets Table:**
- `assigned_technician_id`, `customer_id` → Technicians can't reassign
- Prevents unauthorized work assignment changes

### WITH CHECK Constraints

Policies use `WITH CHECK` to prevent field modification:

```sql
CREATE POLICY persons_update_self ON persons
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (id = current_person_id())
  WITH CHECK (
    id = current_person_id()
    AND OLD.role = NEW.role              -- Can't change role
    AND OLD.business_id = NEW.business_id -- Can't change business
  );
```

## Privacy Protections

### Customer Privacy

- Customers cannot see other customers' data
- Customers cannot see technician personal details
- Customers cannot see location tracking data
- Customers cannot see business payment settings

### Technician Privacy

- Location history only visible to technician and admins
- Performance metrics only visible to admins
- Hourly rates hidden from other technicians

### Business Privacy

- Businesses cannot see other businesses' data
- Subscription details visible only to own admins
- Payment settings isolated per business

## Testing RLS Policies

### Test Pattern

Use `SET request.jwt.claims` to simulate different user contexts:

```sql
-- Simulate customer
SET request.jwt.claims = '{
  "person_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "business_id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "role": "customer"
}';

SELECT * FROM tickets;
-- Should only return customer's own tickets

-- Simulate technician
SET request.jwt.claims = '{
  "person_id": "770e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "business_id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "role": "technician"
}';

SELECT * FROM tickets;
-- Should only return assigned tickets

-- Simulate admin
SET request.jwt.claims = '{
  "person_id": "880e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "business_id": "660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "role": "admin"
}';

SELECT * FROM tickets;
-- Should return all tickets in business

-- Simulate super admin
SET request.jwt.claims = '{
  "person_id": "990e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "role": "super_admin"
}';

SELECT * FROM businesses;
-- Should return all businesses across platform
```

### Test Cases

1. **Cross-Tenant Isolation:** Verify business A cannot see business B's data
2. **Role Enforcement:** Verify customers can't see technician data
3. **Append-Only Protection:** Verify UPDATE/DELETE fails on audit tables
4. **Field Protection:** Verify critical fields can't be modified
5. **Super Admin Bypass:** Verify super admins see all data

## Security Validation

### Automated Checks

Both migration files include validation blocks:

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
  table_name TEXT;
  rls_enabled BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  FOR table_name IN SELECT unnest(ARRAY['businesses', ...])
  LOOP
    SELECT relrowsecurity INTO rls_enabled
    FROM pg_class WHERE relname = table_name;

    IF NOT rls_enabled THEN
      RAISE EXCEPTION 'RLS not enabled on table: %', table_name;
    END IF;
  END LOOP;

  RAISE NOTICE 'All tables have RLS enabled ✓';
END $$;
```

### Manual Verification

Query to check RLS status:

```sql
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity AS rls_enabled
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

Query to count policies per table:

```sql
SELECT
  tablename,
  COUNT(*) AS policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY policy_count DESC;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Policy Optimization

1. **Use Stable Functions:** Helper functions marked `STABLE` for caching
2. **Avoid Nested Subqueries:** Policies optimized for index usage
3. **Composite Indexes:** Added for common business_id + role queries
4. **Partial Indexes:** Created for specific role access patterns

### Index Strategy

Key indexes for RLS performance:

```sql
-- Business-scoped queries
CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_business_id ON tickets(business_id);

-- Role-based queries
CREATE INDEX idx_persons_business_role ON persons(business_id, role);

-- Technician assignment queries
CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_assigned_technician_id
  ON tickets(assigned_technician_id) WHERE assigned_technician_id IS NOT NULL;
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Self + Business Admin

User can access own record, admins can access all in business:

```sql
-- SELECT: Self
CREATE POLICY table_select_self ON table
  FOR SELECT
  USING (person_id = current_person_id());

-- SELECT: Business admin
CREATE POLICY table_select_admin ON table
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    business_id = current_business_id()
    AND current_user_role() = 'admin'
  );
```

### Pattern 2: Assigned + Business Admin

Technician can access assigned entities, admins see all:

```sql
-- SELECT: Assigned technician
CREATE POLICY tickets_select_technician ON tickets
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    assigned_technician_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM technicians WHERE person_id = current_person_id()
    )
    AND current_user_role() = 'technician'
  );

-- SELECT: Business admin
CREATE POLICY tickets_select_admin ON tickets
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    business_id = current_business_id()
    AND current_user_role() = 'admin'
  );
```

### Pattern 3: Admin Only

Only business admins and super admins can access:

```sql
CREATE POLICY payment_settings_modify_admin ON payment_settings
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    (business_id = current_business_id() AND current_user_role() = 'admin')
    OR is_super_admin()
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    (business_id = current_business_id() AND current_user_role() = 'admin')
    OR is_super_admin()
  );
```

### Pattern 4: Append-Only

Allow INSERT, prevent UPDATE/DELETE:

```sql
-- INSERT: Authenticated users
CREATE POLICY audit_logs_insert_authenticated ON audit_logs
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (is_authenticated());

-- NO UPDATE OR DELETE POLICIES
-- Table is append-only by design
```
