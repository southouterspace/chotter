-- Migration: P1.6 - Row Level Security (RLS) for Business Tables
-- Description: Enable RLS and create policies for business-level domain tables
-- Dependencies: 00000000000002_business_core_tables.sql, 00000000000003_supporting_tables.sql,
--               00000000000004_payment_tables.sql, 00000000000005_ai_tables.sql
-- Security Level: CRITICAL - Multi-tenant and role-based data isolation
-- =====================================================================================
--
-- This migration implements comprehensive Row Level Security for 19 business tables:
--
-- CORE TABLES (P1.2):
--   1. persons           2. customers         3. technicians
--   4. services          5. tickets           6. routes
--
-- SUPPORTING TABLES (P1.3):
--   7. media             8. notifications     9. location_history
--   10. geofence_events  11. status_history   12. route_events
--   13. on_call_schedules 14. emergency_requests
--
-- PAYMENT TABLES (P1.4):
--   15. payment_settings 16. pricing_rules    17. payments
--   18. refunds
--
-- AI TABLES (P1.4):
--   19. ai_agents        20. ai_conversations 21. ai_usage_events
--
-- Role-Based Access Control:
--   - customer: See only their own data
--   - technician: See assigned work and related data within business
--   - admin: Full access within their business
--   - super_admin: Full access across all businesses
