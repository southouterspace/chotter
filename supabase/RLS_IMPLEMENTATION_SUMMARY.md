## Security Features

### 1. Multi-Tenant Isolation

**Enforcement:** Every business-level table enforces `business_id = current_business_id()`

**Protection:**
- Business A cannot access Business B's data
- Zero cross-tenant data leakage
- Complete data isolation

**Super Admin Bypass:**
- Platform administrators can access all businesses
- Required for billing, support, and analytics

### 2. Role-Based Access Control

**Role Hierarchy:**
```
super_admin (Platform Level)
    ↓
admin (Business Full Access)
    ↓
technician (Assigned Work + Business Customers)
    ↓
customer (Own Data Only)
```

**Customer Access:**
- Own tickets, payments, refunds
- Notifications sent to them
- AI conversations
- Media for own tickets
- Status history for own tickets

**Technician Access:**
- Assigned tickets and routes
- All customers in business (for service delivery)
- Own location history
- Own on-call schedules
- Payments for worked tickets
- Business services

**Admin Access:**
- All data within their business
- Payment settings and pricing rules
- AI agent configuration
- All tickets, routes, and schedules
- Business profile (excluding status)

**Super Admin Access:**
- All businesses and subscriptions
- Platform settings
- Audit logs
- Subscription tiers
- Full cross-business visibility

### 3. Append-Only Protection

**Protected Tables (6):**
1. audit_logs - Platform audit trail
2. usage_events - Billing usage tracking
3. location_history - GPS tracking
4. geofence_events - Location triggers
5. status_history - Ticket status changes
6. route_events - Route optimization history
7. ai_usage_events - AI billing events

**Protection:** No UPDATE or DELETE policies created. INSERT-only.

**Benefits:**
- Audit trail integrity
- Billing accuracy
- Compliance support
- Historical data preservation

### 4. Field-Level Protection

**Critical Fields Protected:**

**businesses:**
- `status`, `trial_ends_at`, `activated_at` → Super admin only
- Prevents business self-service status manipulation

**persons:**
- `role`, `business_id` → Cannot self-modify
- Prevents privilege escalation

**technicians:**
- `hire_date`, `hourly_rate_cents` → Admin only
- Protects sensitive HR data

**tickets:**
- `assigned_technician_id`, `customer_id` → Technicians can't reassign
- Prevents unauthorized work assignment

### 5. Privacy Protection

**Customer Privacy:**
- Cannot see other customers
- Cannot see technician personal details
- Cannot see location tracking
- Cannot see payment settings

**Technician Privacy:**
- Location data restricted to self and admins
- Performance metrics admin-only
- Compensation hidden from peers

**Business Privacy:**
- Payment settings isolated per business
- Subscription details business-specific
- Complete data separation

## Helper Functions

Five security functions extract JWT claims:

### 1. current_person_id()
```sql
RETURNS UUID
```
Returns authenticated user's person.id from JWT claims.

### 2. current_business_id()
```sql
RETURNS UUID
```
Returns user's business_id from JWT claims (null for super_admins).

### 3. current_user_role()
```sql
RETURNS TEXT
```
Returns user's role: 'customer', 'technician', 'admin', 'super_admin', or 'anonymous'.

### 4. is_super_admin()
```sql
RETURNS BOOLEAN
```
Quick check if user has super_admin role.

### 5. is_authenticated()
```sql
RETURNS BOOLEAN
```
Checks if user has person_id in JWT (logged in).

**Security:** All functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` and `STABLE` for safe caching.

## Policy Patterns

### Pattern 1: Self + Admin Access
```sql
-- User sees own record
CREATE POLICY table_select_self ON table
  FOR SELECT
  USING (person_id = current_person_id());

-- Admin sees all in business
CREATE POLICY table_select_admin ON table
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    business_id = current_business_id()
    AND current_user_role() = 'admin'
  );
```

### Pattern 2: Assigned Work Access
```sql
-- Technician sees assigned tickets
CREATE POLICY tickets_select_technician ON tickets
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    assigned_technician_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM technicians
      WHERE person_id = current_person_id()
    )
    AND current_user_role() = 'technician'
  );
```

### Pattern 3: Admin-Only Access
```sql
CREATE POLICY payment_settings_modify_admin ON payment_settings
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    (business_id = current_business_id() AND current_user_role() = 'admin')
    OR is_super_admin()
  );
```

### Pattern 4: Append-Only
```sql
-- Allow insert only
CREATE POLICY audit_logs_insert_authenticated ON audit_logs
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (is_authenticated());

-- No UPDATE or DELETE policies
```

## Testing & Verification

### Manual Testing

Use `SET request.jwt.claims` to simulate different users:

```sql
-- Test customer isolation
SET request.jwt.claims = '{
  "person_id": "customer-uuid",
  "business_id": "business-uuid",
  "role": "customer"
}';
SELECT * FROM tickets; -- Should only see own tickets

-- Test technician access
SET request.jwt.claims = '{
  "person_id": "tech-uuid",
  "business_id": "business-uuid",
  "role": "technician"
}';
SELECT * FROM customers; -- Should see all business customers

-- Test cross-tenant isolation
SET request.jwt.claims = '{
  "person_id": "admin-uuid",
  "business_id": "business-a-uuid",
  "role": "admin"
}';
SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE business_id = 'business-b-uuid';
-- Should return 0 rows (isolation working)
```

### Automated Verification

Run verification script:
```bash
psql -f /Users/justinalvarado/GitHub/chotter/supabase/verify_rls.sql
```

**Expected Results:**
- Total tables: 28
- Tables with RLS: 28 (100%)
- Total policies: 123
- Tables without policies: 0
- Helper functions: 5

## Security Validation

### Built-In Validation

Both migrations include validation blocks that run automatically:

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
  table_name TEXT;
  rls_enabled BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
  FOR table_name IN SELECT unnest(ARRAY[...])
  LOOP
    SELECT relrowsecurity INTO rls_enabled
    FROM pg_class WHERE relname = table_name;

    IF NOT rls_enabled THEN
      RAISE EXCEPTION 'RLS not enabled on table: %', table_name;
    END IF;
  END LOOP;

  RAISE NOTICE 'All tables have RLS enabled ✓';
END $$;
```

### Manual Queries

Check RLS status:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename;
```

Count policies:
```sql
SELECT tablename, COUNT(*) AS policy_count
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
GROUP BY tablename
ORDER BY policy_count DESC;
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Stable Functions:** Helper functions marked `STABLE` for query plan caching
2. **Composite Indexes:** Added for business_id + role queries
3. **Partial Indexes:** Created for specific role access patterns
4. **Avoid Subqueries:** Policies optimized for direct index usage where possible

### Key Indexes for RLS

```sql
-- Business-scoped queries
CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_business_id ON tickets(business_id);

-- Role-based access
CREATE INDEX idx_persons_business_role ON persons(business_id, role);

-- Assignment queries
CREATE INDEX idx_tickets_assigned_technician_id
  ON tickets(assigned_technician_id)
  WHERE assigned_technician_id IS NOT NULL;
```
