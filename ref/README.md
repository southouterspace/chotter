## ü§ñ Claude Code Agent Reference

### Which Agent to Use When

| Task Type        | Primary Agent          | Supporting Agents     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Database schema  | `database-architect`   | `security-auditor`    |
| API design       | `backend-architect`    | `code-reviewer`       |
| React UI         | `frontend-developer`   | `ui-visual-validator` |
