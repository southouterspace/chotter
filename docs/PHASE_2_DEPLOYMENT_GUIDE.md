## ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Steps Required

### 1. Vercel Team Access

**Issue:** Git author `justin@chotter.dev` needs access to deploy to "South Outer Space's" team projects.

**Solution:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/south-outer-spaces-projects/chotter-admin/settings/members
2. Invite `justin@chotter.dev` as a team member with deployment permissions
3. OR: Use the Vercel dashboard to manually trigger a deployment from the `develop` branch

**Alternative:** Deploy using Vercel dashboard:
1. Visit https://vercel.com/south-outer-spaces-projects/chotter-admin
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Deploy" ‚Üí Select `develop` branch
4. Confirm deployment

---

### 2. Database Migration - Certifications Support

**Issue:** Supabase connection timeouts prevented automatic migration application.

**Migration Required:**
```sql
-- Migration: Add JSONB support for certifications in technician_tags table
ALTER TABLE technician_tags
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tag_value JSONB DEFAULT NULL;

-- Create GIN index for efficient JSONB queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_technician_tags_value
ON technician_tags USING GIN (tag_value);

COMMENT ON COLUMN technician_tags.tag_value IS
  'Structured data for tags (e.g., certification details: issue_date, expiry_date, number)';
```

**How to Apply:**
1. Open Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zlrhcpjlpxzughojpujd/editor
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Paste the migration SQL above
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify: Check that `tag_value` column exists in `technician_tags` table

**Impact if not applied:**
- Technician certifications feature will not work
- Frontend will show errors when trying to save certifications
- All other features will work normally

   - Visit: https://vercel.com/south-outer-spaces-projects/chotter-admin
   - Click "Deployments" ‚Üí "Deploy"
   - Select branch: `develop`
   - Confirm

2. **Monitor Build:**
   - Watch build logs for errors
   - Typical build time: 2-3 minutes
   - Check for TypeScript/build errors

3. **Post-Deployment:**
   - Deployment URL: https://chotter-admin.vercel.app
   - Custom domain (if configured): TBD

### Option B: Via CLI (After Team Access Granted)

```bash
cd /Users/justinalvarado/GitHub/chotter/apps/web-admin
vercel --prod
```

## üîß Environment Variables Verification

Already configured in Vercel (Production, Preview, Development):

| Variable | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | ‚úÖ Set | Verify it has Places API & Maps JavaScript API enabled |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | ‚úÖ Set | Should be https://zlrhcpjlpxzughojpujd.supabase.co |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | ‚úÖ Set | Ensure it matches your Supabase project |

**To Verify:**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/south-outer-spaces-projects/chotter-admin/settings/environment-variables
2. Check all three variables are present
3. Ensure they're enabled for Production, Preview, and Development

## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### 1. Supabase Service Outage
**Status:** Ongoing (as of 2025-10-20)
- Database connection timeouts
- Unable to manage users in Supabase dashboard
- Sign-up returning 500 errors

**Impact:**
- Account creation not working
- Database migration cannot be applied via CLI
- Manual dashboard operations required

**Workaround:**
- Apply migration via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor (see Step 2 above)
- Monitor https://status.supabase.com/

### 2. Route Optimization Backend
**Status:** Client-side placeholder implementation
- "Optimize Route" button works with mock optimization
- Reverses appointment order as placeholder
- Generates random distance/time savings metrics

**Future Enhancement:**
- Integrate Mapbox Optimization API
- Create backend endpoint: `POST /api/routes/:routeId/optimize`
- Replace client-side logic with real route optimization
