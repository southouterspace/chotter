# P2.5 Customer Management - Completion Report

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Status:** COMPLETED ✅
**Completion Percentage:** 100%

## Executive Summary

P2.5 Customer Management has been successfully completed with all acceptance criteria met. The implementation includes a full-featured customer management system with:

- Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Advanced search functionality (name, phone, email)
- Google Places autocomplete for address entry
- Automatic geocoding with PostGIS location storage
- Customer appointment history display
- Pagination for large customer lists

## Implemented Features

### 1. Customer List Display ✅

**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/components/CustomerTable.tsx`

**Features:**
- Displays all customers with key information (name, email, phone, address, status)
- Loading skeleton states during data fetch
- Empty state with helpful messaging
- Clickable rows to view customer details
- Status badge indicators (active/inactive)
- Responsive design with proper mobile support

### 2. Search Functionality ✅

**Implementation:**
- Search by first name, last name, email, or phone number
- Case-insensitive search using PostgreSQL `ilike` operator
- Search form with submit button
- Clear filters option when no results found
- Search input placeholder: "Search by name, email, or phone..."

**Code:**
```typescript
// In useCustomers.ts
if (filters?.search && filters.search.trim()) {
  const searchTerm = filters.search.trim()
  query = query.or(
    `first_name.ilike.%${searchTerm}%,last_name.ilike.%${searchTerm}%,email.ilike.%${searchTerm}%,phone.ilike.%${searchTerm}%`
  )
}
```

### 3. Customer Creation ✅

**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/components/CustomerForm.tsx`

**Features:**
- Comprehensive form with validation (Zod schema)
- Google Places Autocomplete integration
- Fields included:
  - First Name (required)
  - Last Name (required)
  - Email (optional, validated)
  - Phone (required, min 10 digits)
  - Company Name (optional)
  - Status (active/inactive)
  - Source (referral, google_ads, website, repeat, other)
  - Service Address (street, city, state, ZIP - all required)
  - Notes (optional, max 1000 chars)

### 4. Address Geocoding ✅

**Implementation Method:** Google Places Autocomplete API

**Files:**
- `/apps/web-admin/src/components/CustomerForm.tsx`
- `/apps/web-admin/src/hooks/useGeocoding.ts`
- `/apps/web-admin/src/hooks/useCreateCustomer.ts`
- `/apps/web-admin/src/hooks/useUpdateCustomer.ts`

**How It Works:**
1. User starts typing address in the street field
2. Google Places Autocomplete suggests addresses
3. When user selects an address:
   - Street, city, state, ZIP are auto-filled
   - Latitude and longitude are captured
4. On form submit:
   - Coordinates are stored in JSONB `service_address.coordinates`
   - PostGIS `location` field is populated with WKT format: `POINT(lng lat)`
   - `location_verified` is set to `true`

**Environment Variable Required:**
```bash
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
```

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Auto-populate form fields from Google Places
autocomplete.addListener('place_changed', () => {
  const place = autocomplete.getPlace()
  // Extract address components
  // Set latitude and longitude
  form.setValue('service_address.latitude', lat)
  form.setValue('service_address.longitude', lng)
})

// Save to PostGIS location field
if (data.service_address.latitude !== undefined && data.service_address.longitude !== undefined) {
  const locationWKT = `POINT(${data.service_address.longitude} ${data.service_address.latitude})`
  ;(customerData as any).location = locationWKT
  ;(customerData as any).location_verified = true
}
```

### 5. Customer Editing ✅

**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/components/CustomerForm.tsx`

**Features:**
- Same form component used for create and edit
- Pre-populates all fields with existing customer data
- Preserves existing coordinates if address not changed
- Updates coordinates if new address selected via autocomplete
- Success toast notification on update
- Optimistic UI updates via React Query

**Hook:** `/apps/web-admin/src/hooks/useUpdateCustomer.ts`

### 6. Customer Detail View & Appointment History ✅

**File:** `/apps/web-admin/src/components/CustomerDetail.tsx`

**Features:**
- Full customer information display
- Contact information with clickable email/phone links
- Service address display
- Notes section (if present)
- Edit and Delete buttons
- Appointment history table with:
  - Date (formatted as "MMM d, yyyy")
  - Service name
  - Technician name (or "Unassigned")
  - Status badge with color coding
- Empty state for customers with no appointments
- Delete confirmation dialog with warning

**Data Source:**
- Queries `tickets` table filtered by `customer_id`
- Joins with `services` and `technicians` tables
- Includes `persons` data for technician names
- Ordered by `scheduled_for` descending

**Code:**
```typescript
// In useCustomer.ts
const { data: tickets } = await supabase
  .from('tickets')
  .select(`
    *,
    services (name),
    technicians (
      persons (first_name, last_name)
    )
  `)
  .eq('customer_id', customerId)
  .order('scheduled_for', { ascending: false })
```

### 7. Pagination ✅

**Implementation:**
- Page size: 20 customers per page
- Previous/Next navigation buttons
- Current page indicator (e.g., "Page 2 of 15")
- Results counter (e.g., "Showing 21 to 40 of 287 customers")
- Disabled state for buttons at boundaries
- Page resets to 1 when applying filters

**Code:**
```typescript
const page = filters?.page || 1
const pageSize = filters?.pageSize || 20
const from = (page - 1) * pageSize
const to = from + pageSize - 1

query = query.range(from, to)
```

## Known Issues / Blockers

**NONE** - All features are functional and tested.

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for P2.5)

1. **Bulk Import** - CSV upload for customer data
2. **Export** - Download customer list as CSV/Excel
3. **Advanced Filters** - Filter by source, date range, etc.
4. **Customer Tags** - Categorization system
5. **Customer Portal** - Self-service portal for customers
6. **Communication History** - Track emails/SMS sent to customers
7. **Customer Merge** - Combine duplicate customer records
8. **Custom Fields** - Business-specific customer attributes

## Performance Considerations

- Pagination limits result set to 20 items
- Spatial index on `location` field for proximity queries
- React Query caching reduces unnecessary API calls
- Optimistic updates improve perceived performance
- Google Places Autocomplete reduces user typing and errors

## Accessibility

- ✅ Keyboard navigation support
- ✅ ARIA labels on form fields
- ✅ Focus management in dialogs
- ✅ Screen reader compatible
- ✅ Error messages announced
- ✅ Loading states indicated

## Security

- ✅ Row-Level Security (RLS) enforced on customers table
- ✅ Business ID filtering prevents cross-business data access
- ✅ Input validation on all fields
- ✅ SQL injection protection via Supabase client
- ✅ XSS protection via React's built-in escaping

## Conclusion

P2.5 Customer Management is **100% complete** with all acceptance criteria met. The implementation provides a robust, production-ready customer management system with advanced features like geocoding, search, and appointment history.

The geocoding functionality is fully operational using Google Places Autocomplete for address entry and stores coordinates in both JSONB format (for easy retrieval) and PostGIS format (for spatial queries). This dual storage approach enables future features like proximity-based technician assignment and route optimization.
