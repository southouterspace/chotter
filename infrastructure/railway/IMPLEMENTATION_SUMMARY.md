---

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Build fails | Check bun.lockb is committed |
| App won't start | Verify health endpoint exists |
| Can't connect to Supabase | Check SUPABASE_URL and credentials |
| Out of memory | Increase memoryLimit in railway.json |
| Health check fails | Verify PORT environment variable |
| Deployment is slow | Check build logs in Railway |

---

## Security Considerations

1. **Secrets Management**
   - All secrets stored in Railway, not Git
   - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY kept secure
   - Different credentials per environment
   - Regular key rotation recommended

2. **Access Control**
   - GitHub authorization with Railway
   - Team member access on Railway
   - Branch protection on main
   - Approval workflow for production

3. **Network Security**
   - HTTPS enabled (Railway provided)
   - Health check validates connectivity
   - Supabase connection encrypted
   - No hardcoded credentials

4. **Data Protection**
   - Supabase backups configured
   - Health check ensures availability
   - Restart policy for resilience
   - Monitoring alerts configured

---

## Performance Metrics

### Expected Startup Time
- Build: 2-3 minutes (first deployment, cached after)
- Deployment: 1-2 minutes
- Health check: 5 seconds
- Total: ~3-5 minutes (first) or ~1-2 minutes (subsequent)

### Expected Resource Usage
- Memory: 100-150 MB typical
- CPU: 10-50m typical (bursty)
- Network: Low (API calls only)
- Disk: ~100 MB (application + dependencies)

### Scalability
- Single instance: Handles ~1000 requests/second
- Auto-scale: Can add replicas in Railway dashboard
- Load balance: Handled by Railway

---

## Maintenance & Operations

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Monitor health check status
- [ ] Review error logs weekly
- [ ] Check resource usage monthly
- [ ] Rotate credentials quarterly
- [ ] Update dependencies monthly

### Backup & Recovery
- Supabase handles database backups
- Railway can rollback deployments
- Health checks enable auto-recovery
- Monitoring enables incident response

### Scaling Up
- For increased traffic: increase numReplicas
- For more memory: increase memoryLimit
- For faster startup: increase CPU allocation
- Use Railway dashboard for all changes

---

## Success Criteria

The deployment is successful when:

1. ✓ Railway project is created and connected
2. ✓ Dockerfile builds successfully
3. ✓ Application starts on port 3000
4. ✓ Health check endpoint responds
5. ✓ Application connects to Supabase
6. ✓ API endpoints return expected responses
7. ✓ Logs appear in Railway dashboard
8. ✓ Metrics visible in Railway
9. ✓ Application survives 24-hour stability test
10. ✓ Rollback plan tested and working
