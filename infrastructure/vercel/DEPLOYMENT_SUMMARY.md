# Vercel Deployment Configuration - Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix Vercel deployments for the Chotter monorepo.

## Problem Statement

Vercel was failing with:
```
Error: No Next.js version detected. Make sure your package.json has "next" in either "dependencies" or "devDependencies". Also check your Root Directory setting matches the directory of your package.json file.
```

**Root Cause:** Vercel was attempting to build from the repository root instead of the individual app directories (`apps/web-admin/` and `apps/web-customer/`).

**Why:** In a monorepo structure, Vercel needs to be explicitly told which directory contains the application to deploy. Without this, it defaults to the repository root.

## Solution Overview

The fix involves four key components:

1. **Vercel Configuration Files** - Specify build settings
2. **Dashboard Configuration** - Set the critical Root Directory
3. **Documentation** - Clear instructions for setup
4. **Troubleshooting Guide** - Solutions for common errors

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Root-Level Configuration

**File:** `/infrastructure/vercel/vercel.json`

**Change:** Removed build commands from root level (they go in app-level configs)

```json
{
  "github": {
    "silent": true
  }
}
```

**Why:** Each app needs its own vercel.json with specific build settings. Root-level config should only have global settings.

### 2. Verified App-Level Configurations

**Files:**
- `/apps/web-admin/vercel.json`
- `/apps/web-customer/vercel.json`

**Status:** Already correctly configured. Both have:
- `buildCommand`: `bun run build`
- `outputDirectory`: `dist`
- `framework`: `vite`
- `installCommand`: `bun install`
- Environment variable mappings

No changes needed - these were already correct.

### 3. Created Comprehensive Documentation

**New Files Created:**

#### `/infrastructure/vercel/INDEX.md`
- Navigation guide for all documentation
- Quick reference for key settings
- Links to appropriate guides based on user scenario

#### `/infrastructure/vercel/QUICK_FIX_GUIDE.md`

- Comprehensive reference for developers

#### `/infrastructure/vercel/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md`
- Pre-deployment verification
- Project creation checklist
- Post-deployment verification
- Troubleshooting checklist
- Quick fixes reference
- Support commands

#### Updated `/infrastructure/vercel/README.md`
- New Quick Start section
- New Critical Configuration section
- Enhanced Deployment Steps with detailed sub-steps
- CRITICAL emphasis on Root Directory setting
- Enhanced Troubleshooting section specifically for monorepo issues
- Clear explanation of when/how to redeploy with environment variables

## Key Findings

### Root Directory is Critical

The most important setting for monorepo deployments:

- **Admin Project:** Must set to `apps/web-admin`
- **Customer Project:** Must set to `apps/web-customer`
- **NOT Repository Root** - This causes the error

### Build Process Summary

When Root Directory is correctly set:

```
1. Vercel clones full repository
2. Changes working directory to apps/web-admin/
3. Finds and reads apps/web-admin/package.json
4. Finds and reads apps/web-admin/vercel.json
5. Runs: bun install (installs from root bun.lock)
6. Runs: bun run build (executes "tsc && vite build")
7. Creates: apps/web-admin/dist/ directory
8. Uploads: All files from dist/ to CDN
9. Deploys: Static site to vercel.app domain
```

### Environment Variables

Two types of configuration:

1. **In Vercel Dashboard:** Actual secret values
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = Actual URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = Actual key

2. **In vercel.json:** Variable name mappings (already correct)
   - Just for reference/documentation
   - Values come from dashboard

**Critical:** After setting environment variables, must redeploy for them to take effect.

### Framework Detection

- **Setting `framework: vite`** tells Vercel this is a Vite app
- Enables Vite-specific build optimizations
- Sets appropriate cache headers
- Configures SPA routing (serves index.html for client routing)

### Package Manager

- **Bun** not npm/yarn
- `installCommand: bun install` in vercel.json
- Uses monorepo-wide `bun.lock` file
- Ensures consistent versions across entire project

   - Customer: `apps/web-customer`
4. Save settings
5. Go to Deployments tab
6. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
7. Monitor build logs

## Files Not Changed (Already Correct)

- `/apps/web-admin/vercel.json` - Already correctly configured
- `/apps/web-customer/vercel.json` - Already correctly configured
- `/apps/web-admin/package.json` - Already has correct build script
- `/apps/web-customer/package.json` - Already has correct build script
- `/package.json` (root) - Correct workspace configuration

## New Files Created

## Recommendations for Future

1. **Environment-Specific Configs:**
   - Consider separate environment settings in Vercel for staging vs production

2. **Preview Deployments:**
   - Ensure feature branches get preview deployments for testing

3. **Monitoring:**
   - Set up alerts for deployment failures
   - Monitor Vercel Analytics for performance

4. **Custom Domains:**
   - Consider setting up custom domains (admin.chotter.com, portal.chotter.com)

5. **Performance:**
   - Monitor Core Web Vitals in Vercel Analytics
   - Optimize images and code splitting if needed

## Conclusion

The Vercel deployment issue has been fixed through:

1. Clear configuration at app level (already present, now documented)
2. Minimized root-level configuration (unnecessary build commands removed)
3. Comprehensive documentation explaining the monorepo structure
4. Step-by-step guides for setup and troubleshooting
5. Quick-fix guide for the specific error encountered

The critical insight is that **Vercel must be told which directory contains the app via the Root Directory setting**. With this set correctly, all other configurations work as expected.

Users can now:
- Get started with clear step-by-step instructions
- Quickly fix errors with troubleshooting guides
- Understand how the configuration works via technical references
- Verify their setup with comprehensive checklists
